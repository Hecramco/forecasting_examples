# âš¡ Forecasting with Machine Learning

**Developed by** : Hector M. RamÃ­rez C.

**Datasets** :

* [Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data) (Kaggle)
* [Stock News &amp; Stock Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/) (Kaggle / public sources)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository showcases **end-to-end forecasting pipelines** using machine learning on two domains:

1. **Energy Consumption Forecasting** â€“ Predicting electricity demand to support more sustainable, efficient, and eco-friendly energy systems.
2. **Stock Forecasting with Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Exploring how combining financial time series with news sentiment can improve predictions in highly volatile markets.

Both examples highlight how **machine learning can uncover hidden patterns in time-dependent data** and generate actionable insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Demonstrate forecasting workflows that mix **statistical methods, ML models, and feature engineering**
* Highlight how **domain knowledge** (energy â†’ sustainability, finance â†’ sentiment/news) makes predictions more relevant
* Show the versatility of ML applied to **different time series challenges**
* Share a personal commitment to using AI for **sustainability and social good**

## ðŸ§ª Technical Highlights

### ðŸ”‹ Energy Consumption

* **Methods** : ARIMA, XGBoost
* **Features** : Lagged variables, rolling statistics, seasonal decomposition
* **Results** :
  * RMSE: ~145 MW
  * RÂ² Score: 0.996
  * Residuals normally distributed â†’ model generalizes well

### ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prices with Sentiment

* **Methods** : XGBoost, ARIMA, Feature engineering , Transformers/FinBERT (sentiment analysis on financial news)
* **Features** : Numerical (stock prices), categorical (tickers), textual (news sentiment)
* **Results** :
  * RMSE: ~19.2 USD
  * RÂ² Score: 0.9825
  * Demonstrates benefit of **multimodal forecasting**

## ðŸŒ± Why This Matters

Forecasting is more than just predicting numbers â€” it can guide  **real-world decisions** :

* âš¡ **Energy** â†’ Better integration of renewable sources, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, smarter grid planning
* ðŸ’¹ **Finance** â†’ Understanding market dynamics, bridging human behavior (news sentiment) with quantitative models

This dual focus reflects my personal interests in:

* Clean tech and **climate resilience**
* **Data-driven decision-making** for complex systems
* Applying ML where it can **benefit people and the planet**
