# âš¡Forecast project:  Energy Data

**Project Developed by**: Hector M. RamÃ­rez C.

Data: [Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/data) from Kaggle.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Energy conspumption has become a major indicator, sustainable developement seeks to reduce the CO2 consuption by taking different meassures such as change the way we eat, the way we move and the way we consume energy but also the sources that are used. Forecasting energy consumption is an important step in the process to migrate to new technologies. By Forecasting the energy consumption it is possible to have an idea of the demand a company will face in a certain period, then the use of batteries and renewable energies can help to prepare for a possible rise or drop in demand based on former meassurable data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

As a personal  project, this aims to show an example of data analysis using energy data, by using different tools and models such as ARIMA and XGBoost. 

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `data/`: This directory is used to store the energy data downloaded from kaggle.
* `notebooks/:`: Jupyter Notebooks with exploratory analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
* `saved_models/`: Storage of the las trained model.
* `requirements.txt`: Requirements to run the experiments.
